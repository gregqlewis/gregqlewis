## Featured Projects

### ☁️ Cloud Security Labs
**Multi-cloud security engineering portfolio demonstrating IAM architecture, least-privilege design, and Infrastructure as Code automation**

Production-quality cloud security implementations across AWS and Azure, built entirely with Terraform.

**Completed Implementations:**
- ✅ **Account Security Baselines:** CloudTrail/Activity Log configuration, MFA enforcement, budget monitoring
- ✅ **Custom IAM Policies:** Least-privilege security auditor roles with granular permission boundaries
- ✅ **IAM Access Analyzer:** External access detection and privilege escalation monitoring
- ✅ **MFA-Enforced Role Assumption:** Tested temporary credential workflows and session policies
- ✅ **AWS vs Azure IAM Comparison:** Comprehensive architectural analysis of identity management approaches

**Planned Enhancements (Post-CISSP September 2026):**
- 📋 GuardDuty & Microsoft Sentinel threat detection deployment
- 📋 Network security architectures (VPC/VNet with security group design)
- 📋 Purple team cloud attack/defense scenarios (IAM privilege escalation, lateral movement)

**Tech Stack:** Terraform, AWS IAM/CloudTrail, Azure AD/RBAC/Activity Logs, Python

### 🔴🔵 Purple Team Home Lab
**MITRE ATT&CK-mapped security testing environment demonstrating offensive and defensive security capabilities**

Production-grade purple team infrastructure built on Unraid, showcasing detection engineering and attack simulation expertise.

**Architecture:**
- **Attack Platform:** Kali Linux (Raspberry Pi 4), Metasploitable 3, DVWA
- **Detection Stack:** Wazuh SIEM, Graylog, OpenSearch, MongoDB
- **Methodology:** MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping with custom detection rules
- **Coverage:** 20+ techniques across Initial Access, Privilege Escalation, Credential Access, Lateral Movement

**Key Implementations:**
- Custom Wazuh detection rules for container escape (T1611), credential theft (T1552), privilege escalation (T1548)
- Automated vulnerable environment deployment with Bash scripting
- Attack scenario documentation with detection validation
- Network protocol security analysis (SSH, FTP, NFS, SMB, Docker API)

**Planned Additions (CISSP Study Integration):**
- 📋 Network detection layer (Suricata) for SMB/RPC enumeration gaps
- 📋 Cryptographic implementations (TLS for Docker API, encrypted credentials)
- 📋 Formal penetration test report demonstrating assessment methodology
